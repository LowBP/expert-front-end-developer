## **JavaScript and TypeScript:**

  1. Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.

      - In JavaScript, objects can share properties and methods through a mechanism called prototypal inheritance.
      - Every object has a hidden link to another object called its "prototype".
      - When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it looks in the prototype linked to that object, and so on, forming a chain.
      - Constructor functions are used to create objects with shared behavior. Objects created from the same constructor function share the same prototype.
      - Methods can be added to an object's prototype, making them available to all objects created from the same constructor function.
    
  2. What are the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript?

      - Introduced support for creating smooth transitions and animations with CSS.
     
   2. How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility when writing HTML and CSS code?

      1. **Testing**: Regularly test the website or app in different browsers and versions to catch compatibility issues.
  
      2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with a basic version and enhance it progressively for better compatibility.
        
      3. **Vendor Prefixes**: Add vendor prefixes for CSS properties (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, -o-) for broader compatibility.
        
      4. **Feature Detection**: Employ feature detection techniques to apply appropriate styles based on browser capabilities.
        
      5. **Fallbacks and Polyfills**: Provide fallbacks or polyfills for unsupported CSS and JavaScript features.
        
      6. **Validation**: Validate your HTML and CSS code to ensure compliance with web standards.
        
      7. **Use Modern CSS Resets**: Start with a modern CSS reset to establish consistent baseline styles.

   3. Have you used any HTML5 APIs in your projects? If so, which ones and how did you implement them?

      1. **Web Storage API**:
         - **Implementation**: In a project where user preferences or session data need to be stored locally, the Web Storage API (specifically localStorage or sessionStorage) can be used. For example, to store user settings such as theme preferences, you could use `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')` to store the theme preference, and `localStorage.getItem('theme')` to retrieve it later. This data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, providing a seamless user experience.
      
      2. **Web Video API**:
         - **Implementation**: To embed and control video playback in a web application, the Web Video API can be utilized. For instance, you can create an HTML5 video element `<video>` and control its playback using JavaScript. You can use methods like `play()` and `pause()` to control the video playback, and events like `onplay`, `onpause`, and `ontimeupdate` to handle playback events dynamically. This allows for custom video player implementations with features like custom controls, playback speed adjustments, and video manipulation.
      
      3. **Canvas**:
         - **Implementation**: Canvas is used for rendering dynamic graphics, animations, and visualizations directly in the browser. For example, in a project requiring interactive charts or diagrams, you can use the Canvas API to draw shapes, lines, text, and images programmatically. By accessing the 2D rendering context (`getContext('2d')`), you can use methods like `fillRect()`, `strokeRect()`, and `drawImage()` to draw on the canvas. Additionally, you can animate graphics by updating the canvas content within requestAnimationFrame loops, providing smooth and responsive visualizations.
        


   3. Have you used any HTML5 APIs in your projects? If so, which ones and how did you implement them?

       6+ years

## **SASS:**

   1. What are the main advantages of using SASS over traditional CSS?

      - SASS allows you to use variables for easy reuse of values.
      - It lets you nest CSS selectors within one another, improving readability.
      - SASS introduces mixins for reusable blocks of CSS code.
      - You can use @extend to inherit styles between selectors, reducing redundancy.
      - SASS supports breaking stylesheets into smaller files and importing them.
      - It allows math operations within stylesheets for dynamic calculations.
      - SASS offers control directives like @if, @for, and @each for advanced logic.


   2. How do you organize your SASS files and structure your code for maintainability?

      1. **Folder Structure**:
         - Keep your styles organized in folders like `base`, `components`, `layouts`, `pages`, and `utilities`.
      
      2. **Main Stylesheet**:
         - Use a main stylesheet (e.g., `styles.scss`) and import other stylesheets in a logical order.
      
      3. **Vue Component Styles**:
         - Write styles for Vue components directly inside the component files.
      
      4. **Modular Approach**:
         - Break down your styles into smaller files, like `_variables.scss` and `_mixins.scss`, and import them as needed.
      
      5. **Global Styles**:
         - Import global styles or variables/mixins in the main entry point of your application.
      
      6. **Vue CLI Configuration**:
         - Set up SASS/SCSS support in your Vue project using Vue CLI's built-in tools.
      
      7. **Version Control**:
         - Use Git to track changes in your SASS files and collaborate with others effectively.
        
   3. Can you explain the concept of mixins in SASS and provide an example of how you've used them in your projects?

      Mixins in SASS are like ready-made bundles of CSS styles that you can reuse. They help you avoid writing the same code repeatedly. Here's an easy example:

      **Explanation**:
      
      Think of mixins as templates for CSS styles. Instead of typing out the same CSS styles every time, you create a mixin once and then use it wherever you need those styles.
      
      **Example**:
      
      ```scss
      // Define the mixin
      @mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $color) {
        box-shadow: $x $y $blur $color;
      }
      
      // Use the mixin
      .element1 {
        @include box-shadow(2px, 2px, 4px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1));
      }
      
      .element2 {
        @include box-shadow(0, 0, 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2));
      }
      ```

      I use mixins for common tasks like adding vendor prefixes or creating reusable design patterns. For example, I might create a mixin for flexbox layouts or media queries to keep my code clean and easy to maintain. Mixins help me write less code and make changes quickly across my project.

   4. When and for how long have you used SASS?

## **General:**

   1. Describe a challenging front end problem you encountered in a project and how you solved it.

      I faced a tough problem while working on a web app that needed to show big tables with lots of data. The goal was to make these tables load fast and work smoothly, even when users scrolled and used sorting or filtering.

      To fix this, I did a few things:
      
      - I used virtual scrolling. This means the app only shows the rows you can see on the screen, not the whole table. It made the app load faster and use less memory.
      - Instead of getting all the data from the server at once, I set up server-side pagination and filtering. This way, the app only gets the data it needs for the current page or filters. It made things faster.
      - I made sure the app loads only what's needed. For example, it only loads the parts of the table you're looking at. If you need more, it loads that when you ask for it.
      - I made the app render things faster by being smarter about when it redraws parts of the screen. This made the app feel quicker.
      - I split the code into smaller pieces and only loaded what was needed for each part of the app. This made the app start faster and work better overall.
      
      These changes made a big difference. Now, the tables in the app load quickly, work smoothly and let users sort and filter without any issues.

   2. How do you stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in front end development?

      Staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in front-end development is essential for me. Here's how I do it:
